# Conduit Connector for <!-- readmegen:name -->Dynamodb<!-- /readmegen:name -->
A DynamoDB connector for [Conduit](https://conduit.io), It provides both, a source and a destination DynamoDB connector.

## How to build?

Run `make build` to build the connector.

## Testing

Run `make test-integration` to run all the integration tests. Tests require Docker to be installed and running.
The command will handle starting and stopping docker containers for you.

If you want to run the integration tests against your AWS DynamoDB instead of docker, You must set the environment
variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`) before running `make test`, 
or before running the tests manually.

## Source
A source connector that pulls data from a DynamoDB table to downstream resources via Conduit.

The connector starts with a snapshot of the data currently existent in the table, sends these records to the
destination, then starts the CDC (Change Data Capture) mode which will listen to events happening on the table
in real-time, and sends these events' records to the destination (these events include: `updates`, `deletes`, and `inserts`).
You can opt out from taking the snapshot by setting the parameter `skipSnapshot` to `true`, meaning that only the CDC
events will be captured.

The source connector uses [DynamoDB Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html) to get CDC events,
so you need to enable the stream before running the connector. Check out the documentation for [how to enable a DynamoDB Stream](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html#Streams.Enabling).

## Destination
A destination connector that takes a conduit record and stores it into a DynamoDB table.

The Destination is designed to handle different kinds of operations, based on the `Operation` field in the record
received, the destination will either `insert`, `update` or `delete` the record in the target table. Snapshot records
are always inserted.

> **Note:** Make sure to create the destination table before running the pipeline, the table needs to have the same
schema as the records that will be sent into it, either from the source, or from a processor.
